# Flowstate - Campus Health Companion 🦅

A high-performance web app designed for college students to build healthy habits and find trustworthy health information. Starting at Florida Gulf Coast University (FGCU).

## ⚡ Performance Optimizations

This version includes significant performance improvements to achieve high PageSpeed Insights scores:

### 🚀 Speed Improvements
- **Code Splitting**: Lazy loading of FoodScannerModal component reduces initial bundle size
- **CSS Optimization**: Separated CSS file with critical styles inlined in HTML
- **Font Loading**: Using `font-display: swap` to prevent font blocking
- **Terser Minification**: Advanced JavaScript minification in production builds
- **Tree Shaking**: Automatic removal of unused code
- **Chunk Splitting**: Vendor and icon libraries separated for better caching

### 📦 Bundle Size Reduction
- **External CSS**: Styles moved from inline to external stylesheet
- **Optimized Icons**: Only importing used icons from lucide-react
- **Manual Chunks**: React, ReactDOM, and icons split into separate chunks
- **Minified Output**: Console logs and debugger statements removed in production

### 🎨 Rendering Optimization
- **CSS Classes**: Replaced inline styles with CSS classes for better performance
- **Reduced Re-renders**: Optimized component structure
- **Preconnect**: DNS prefetch and preconnect for Google Fonts
- **Initial Loader**: Prevents cumulative layout shift (CLS)

### 📊 Expected Improvements
